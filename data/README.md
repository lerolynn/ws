# Data 

## Directory hierarchy

From the root directory of the repository, run `setup.sh` to download the datasets from the official websites and rearrange to the directory hierarchy as follows. 

While the VOC dataset provides the segmentation masks in the `SegmentationClass` directory, 

the COCO dataset provides segmentation annotations, which have to be converted to 

`gt_mask` 

```py

```

_Note: The folders of the COCO dataset downloaded were moved into the respective subdirectories and renamed to follow the convention used by the VOC dataset for greater clarity._

### USED data

SegmentationClass
- Original pixel-level ground truth labels in color
- Labels use the original Pascal VOC colormap
- `trainval.txt` split, 2913 items

SegmentationClass_gt
- Ground truth labels using single color channel
- Converted using `utils/remove_colormap.py` from SegmentationClass labels
- `trainval.txt` split, 2913 items

SegmentationClass_pseudo
- pseudo labels generated from IRN
- `train.txt` split, 1464 items


### Others


## COCO

```

|- Annotations
|- coco_seg_anno
|- JPEGImages
| | - train2014
| | - val2014
 - labels.txt

```

Annotations and JPEGImages are downloaded from the COCO official website

`coco_seg_anno` has the image annotations for semantic segmentation. The annotations can be downloaded from the link below and is provide by the [RIB](https://github.com/jbeomlee93/RIB) repository
